/**
 * The java virtual machine zeroes the bits of the object after it allocates storage,
 * producing a default value for i before any other initialization occurs.
 * The code calls the base-class constructor before running the derived-class initialization,
 * so we see the zeroed value of i as the initial output.
 * The danger of calling a method inside a constructor is when that method depends on a derived initialization.
 * Before the derived-class constructor is called,
 * the object may be in an unexpected state (in Java, at least that state is defined;
 * this is not true with all languages â€“ C++, for example).
 * The safest approach is to set the object into a known good state as simply as possible,
 * and then perform any other operations outside the constructor.
